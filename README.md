## Project Biography

    **TLDR**
    
	My project is a tool to assist potential tenants in completing comprehensive “Statement of Conditions” when signing a rental agreement. The form itself is minimalist and therefor is often overlooked by renters, while abused by landlords who are looking to withhold security deposits. My goal was to create a usable form that could help eliminate this point of tension between tenants and landlord. Ultimately, my ambitious take on the project and limited coding skills were the true point of tension and resulted in a less robust tool than originally envisioned. Ideally, someone with a greater skillset will be able to launch from where I have left off and complete the tool as originally envisioned. 
    
    **The Problem**
    
    	Scummy landlords, aren’t they the worst? When signing a lease agreement, every tenant is supposed to go through the rental space with the landlord and both are supposed to document and then sign a “Statement of Conditions” form. This form can be used when the tenant eventually moves out of the rental as a benchmark for establishing whether the tenant will recover their security deposit. 
	
    Unfortunately, there is an inherent power imbalance between the landlord and renter. Renters are often young, low-income, immigrant, or elderly; while landlords are often wealthy and have made careers out of being property owners/managers. Most every tenant wants to, and believes they will, recover their security deposit when they move out. Most landlords want to keep the security deposit, its money to their bottom line and can be used to market the rental if there isn’t another renter lined up. 

This conflict can arise in many ways during the signing of a lease. But most of the ways can be generally summed up by landlords rushing or pressuring renters to sign incomplete statement of condition forms that do not comprehensively and accurately portray the status of the rental. 


    **Research**

    My researching of the problem comes largely from personal experience and discussing with industry experts. Prior to law school, I had a length career in real estate development, sales, and rentals. Boston is an especially lucrative real estate rental market with one-bedroom apartments renting for over $2,000/month. 
	
    Currently, there is not universal solution for this problem. There are some pay-to-play apps that both landlord and renter can sign up for, sign into, and write their own version of events and upload photos. There are also some in-house programs operated by large real estate agencies and property management groups. Subscription based programs are not an effective solution when there is a large economic imbalance between parties. Likewise, real estate agencies and property management groups have a financial incentive to favor landlords. These do not present a fair, open, and equitable solution. 
	
    I continued my research by reaching out to several realtors still in the industry. Those in Boston reported that they had not heard of any service or platform that offered what I was proposing. One even said their office never used Statement of Condition forms and would only use them upon request. Although my tool would only apply to the state of Massachusetts, I reached out to former professional peers in other states. Those practicing real estate in New York City had heard of the idea of a comprehensive online statement of conditions tool but had never seen it used nor had they heard of it as a free-to-use open-source tool. My real estate peers in Virginia likewise had no knowledge of any opensource statement of conditions tools. 
    
    Internet research resulted no results either, beyond the subscription-based models. My research concluded that no open-source equitable tool for complete statement of conditions forms current exists.
